Immortalizing my old dog inside the World of Qud. Someday he won't be here anymore, but for sure people can find him somewhere in-game.

This repository contains the source for a mod developed using Snapjaw Mages modding tutorial on the Caves of Qud wiki:
https://wiki.cavesofqud.com/wiki/Modding:Tutorial_-_Snapjaw_Mages

I created this mod in order to prove that ANYONE can create its own content for Caves of Qud following the tutorial.

You can find the mod in Steam Workshop:
